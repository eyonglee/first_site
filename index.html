            <p>Rosie is a small but super energetic dog. Whenever someone comes to the house she is very quick to run up and greet them. She loves to play fetch and will not leave you alone with her toys as she begs you to play with her.</p>
            <p>Rosie is also a wonderful lap dog. If you sit on the couch she is quick to find a spot next to you. If you wear a blanket over your legs, you'll find her laying on your legs. She loves to cuddle and loves to be pet so she will always be right up on you.</p>

            <h2>Jingle</h2>


            <img src="images/jingle.jpg" alt="Picture of Jingle" width="500">


            <p>Jingle is a domestic shorthair cat with a white chest and belly and a striped black and gray back. His
                paws are
                white and they look like mittens.
                Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get
                injured.
                Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes
                crazy
                and meows to go out.</p>

            <p>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside;
                a bee
                stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for
                four
                days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.</p>
